#
# Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":
# 
# 
# The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child
# pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is
# always null.
# The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the
# binary tree.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
# Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [0]
# Output: [0]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Can you flatten the tree in-place (with O(1) extra space)?
#
