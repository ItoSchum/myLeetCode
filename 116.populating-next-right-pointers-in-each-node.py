#
# You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level,
# and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following
# definition:
# 
# 
# struct Node {
# ⁠ int val;
# ⁠ Node *left;
# ⁠ Node *right;
# ⁠ Node *next;
# }
# 
# 
# Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no
# next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
# 
# Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# 
# You may only use constant extra space.
# Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not
# count as extra space for this problem.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
# Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
# Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function
# should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like
# in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next
# pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the given tree is less than 4096.
# -1000 <= node.val <= 1000
#

# Definition for a Node.

        self.right = right

        self.sub_connect(root.left, root.right)
        return root
        
    def sub_connect(self, left: 'Node', right: 'Node'):
        
        if left == None or right == None:

        left.next = right
        self.sub_connect(left.left, left.right)
        self.sub_connect(left.right, right.left)
        self.sub_connect(right.left, right.right)
