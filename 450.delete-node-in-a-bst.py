#
# Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the
# given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of
# the BST.
# 
# Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
# 
# 
# Search for a node to remove.
# If the node is found, delete the node.
# 
# 
# Follow up: Can you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
# Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
# Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and
# delete it.
# One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
# Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's
# also accepted.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
# Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
# Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [], key = 0
# Output: []
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
# -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
# Each node has a unique value.
# root is a valid binary search tree.
# -10^5 <= key <= 10^5
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
